<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>The Bible App uses a simple credits system to reward your engagement.</p>

<h2>How Credits Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You earn credits each time you perform a search.</li>
  <li>Credits can unlock additional features in the app.</li>
  <li>Credits are virtual points — they are not real money and cannot be withdrawn or transferred.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Balance</h2>
{% if credits is not none %}
  <p>You currently have <strong>{{ credits }}</strong> credits.</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Enter your email during searches to track your credits.</p>
{% endif %}

<h2>Why Credits?</h2>
<p>Credits encourage regular study and exploration of scripture. They also help us personalize your experience in the app.</p>
