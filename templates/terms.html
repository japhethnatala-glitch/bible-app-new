    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Bible App. By using this app, you agree to the following terms:</p>

    <h2>Credits System</h2>
    <p>Credits are virtual points earned by interacting with the app (e.g., searching verses).
       Credits can unlock features but do not represent real money.
       They cannot be withdrawn or transferred outside the app.</p>

    <h2>Ads</h2>
    <p>We display ads through Google AdSense. Revenue from ads is managed by Google and does not affect your credits.</p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the app respectfully and not misuse its features.
       Any attempt to manipulate credits or ads may result in account suspension.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app means you accept the changes.</p>
